# Personal dotfiles for ubuntu

The themes in this repository do not belong to me. They are the [Colloid gtk theme from vinceliuice](https://github.com/vinceliuice/Colloid-gtk-theme). I am satisfied with this version of the theme, so I have decided to keep it without installing from source.

The `open_in_code.sh` script file is also not mine but from [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cra0zy/code-nautilus/master/install.sh). I am keeping this file locally to avoid the original file from being deleted
