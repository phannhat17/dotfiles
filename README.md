Personal dotfiles for ubuntu

The themes in this repository is not belong to me. It is [Colloid gtk theme from vinceliuice](https://github.com/vinceliuice/Colloid-gtk-theme) (I feel fine with this version of the theme so I decided to keep it without installing from source)  


the `open_in_code.sh` script file is also not mine but from [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cra0zy/code-nautilus/master/install.sh). I keep this file locally just to avoid the original file being deleted
